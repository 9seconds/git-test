# git-test

A unified way of running your tests

This script was extracted from my dotfiles and placed in standalone
repository, so test infrastructure etc is on the way. But I want to keep
main principles of this script as is:

1. This script is self-contained. No external dependency is required.
2. It should be run with Python 2.7, Python >= 3.4 and PyPy.
3. This should be a single script you can copy-paste here and there.
